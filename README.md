# AI Playground Backend

This is the backend for the AI Playground, featuring a sophisticated **specialized multi-agent system** that provides intelligent routing, enhanced security, and seamless blockchain operations for Story Protocol.

## ü§ñ Key Features

### **Specialized Multi-Agent Architecture**
- **9 Specialized Agents**: Each agent focuses on specific Story Protocol domains with dedicated tool access
  - `IP_ASSET_AGENT`: IP asset creation, registration, metadata, and IPFS operations
  - `IP_ACCOUNT_AGENT`: ERC20 token management, balance checks, test token minting  
  - `IP_LICENSE_AGENT`: License terms, token minting, and licensing workflows
  - `NFT_CLIENT_AGENT`: SPG NFT collection creation and contract management
  - `DISPUTE_AGENT`: Dispute raising and resolution processes
  - `ROYALTY_AGENT`: Royalty payments and revenue claiming
  - `WIP_AGENT`: Wrapped IP token operations (deposits, transfers)
  - `GROUP_AGENT` & `PERMISSION_AGENT`: Future functionality placeholders

### **Intelligent Supervisor System**
- **Smart Request Routing**: Automatically routes user requests to the most appropriate specialist
- **Sequential Coordination**: Manages complex multi-step workflows across agents
- **Response Preservation**: Passes through specialist responses verbatim without modification
- **Unified Interface**: Users interact with a single supervisor without knowing about individual agents

### **Advanced Security & Confirmation System**
- **Stateless MCP Sessions**: Reliable interrupt handling without persistent connection issues
- **Transaction Safety**: Automatic confirmation requirements for blockchain operations
- **User-Friendly Confirmations**: Enhanced parameter formatting for clear user understanding
- **Risky Tool Detection**: Automated identification of sensitive operations requiring approval

### **Enhanced Architecture**
- **Backend Chat History**: All conversations stored using LangGraph checkpointer (InMemorySaver)
- **Simplified Communication**: Frontend only sends latest user message, reducing complexity
- **Improved Agent Prompts**: Enhanced prompting system for better agent behavior
- **Tool Segregation**: Each agent has access only to relevant tools for their domain

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### **Multi-Agent Flow**
1. **User Request** ‚Üí **Supervisor Agent** analyzes and routes to appropriate specialist
2. **Specialist Agent** executes domain-specific operations with dedicated tools
3. **Interrupt System** triggers for sensitive blockchain operations requiring user confirmation
4. **Frontend Confirmation** ‚Üí User approves/rejects through intuitive popup interface
5. **Resume Execution** ‚Üí Agent continues or cancels based on user decision

### **Key Components**
- `supervisor_agent_system.py` - Multi-agent supervisor and coordination
- `interrupt_handler.py` - Stateless interrupt system with user-friendly formatting  
- `tool_categories.py` - Tool organization and access control
- `sdk_mcp_agent.py` - Enhanced SDK agent with improved prompts
- `chat.py` - Streaming chat API with interrupt handling

### **Conversation State Management**
- **Checkpointer**: LangGraph InMemorySaver maintains full conversation history
- **Thread Safety**: Conversation-scoped supervisor instances prevent state conflicts
- **Resume Capability**: Interrupted conversations can be resumed from exact checkpoint

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Node.js 18+ (for frontend)
- Story Protocol account and API key
- Pinata account and JWT (for IPFS operations)
- RPC Provider URL for blockchain access

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ai-playground-backend
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install .
```

Alternatively, you can install all dependencies including development tools with:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

4. Set up environment variables:

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file to include:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
RPC_PROVIDER_URL=your-ethereum-rpc-url
WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=your-wallet-private-key  # Optional: Only needed for server-side signing
PINATA_JWT=your-pinata-jwt  # Optional: Only needed for IPFS operations
```

## Usage

### Running the server

Start the server with:

```bash
python -m api.index
```

This will start the server on port 8000 by default. You can specify a different port by setting the `PORT` environment variable.

### Available MCPs

1. **Storyscan MCP** - For blockchain analytics
2. **SDK MCP** - For Story SDK operations with wallet integration

## SDK MCP Setup

The SDK MCP requires the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install story-protocol-python-sdk web3
```

If you encounter the error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'story_protocol_python_sdk'`, make sure to install the package using:

```bash
pip install story-protocol-python-sdk
```

## Docker Support

You can also run the application using Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start both the backend and necessary services.

## Development

### Local Development

For local development, you can use the provided `localdeploy.sh` script:

```bash
./localdeploy.sh
```

This will start the server with hot-reloading enabled for faster development.

### Working with MCPs

To work with both the Storyscan MCP and the SDK MCP, you'll need to:

1. Clone the MCP repositories in the same parent directory as this project
2. Ensure the directory structure is as follows:
   - `/your/workspace/ai-playground-backend`
   - `/your/workspace/story-mcp-hub/storyscan-mcp`
   - `/your/workspace/story-mcp-hub/story-sdk-mcp`

3. Set the environment variables in your `.env` file:
   ```
   MCP_SERVER_PATH=/app/story-mcp-hub/storyscan-mcp/server.py
   SDK_MCP_SERVER_PATH=/app/story-mcp-hub/story-sdk-mcp/server.py
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing SDK dependencies**: If you see errors about missing modules, ensure you have installed all required packages with `pip install story-protocol-python-sdk web3`.

2. **StoryClient initialization errors**: The StoryClient initializer requires `web3`, `account`, and `chain_id` parameters. If you see errors like `StoryClient.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument`, check that your code is using the correct parameter format.

3. **RPC connection issues**: If you see errors connecting to the blockchain, check your RPC provider URL in the `.env` file.
